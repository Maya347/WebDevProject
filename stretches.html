        <div id="downward_dog">
            <img src="img/Downward Dog.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the downward dog stretch">
            <p> <strong> Downward Dog:</strong> Downward Dog stretches the hamstrings, calves, shoulders, and back. It
                also lengthens the
                spine and builds flexibility in the ankles and wrists. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="standing_pike">
            <img src="img/Standing Pike.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the standing pike stretch">
            <p><strong>Standing Pike:</strong> In the Standing Pike, you bend forward to touch your toes, deeply
                stretching the
                hamstrings, calves, and lower back. It also improves spinal flexibility and can release tension in the
                neck.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="sitting_pike">
            <img src="img/Sitting Pike.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the sitting pike stretch">
            <p><strong>Sitting Pike: </strong>The Sitting Pike targets the hamstrings and lower back while also gently
                stretching the
                calves. It helps improve posture and forward-fold flexibility in the seated position. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="lunge">
            <img src="img/Lunge.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the lunge stretch">
            <p><strong>Lunge: </strong>A standard lunge stretch works the hip flexors, quads, and glutes of the rear
                leg, and stretches
                the hamstrings of the front leg. It's commonly used to open the hips and improve lower-body mobility.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="modified_lunge">
            <img src="img/Modified Lunge.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the modified lunge stretch">
            <p> <strong>Modified Lunge: </strong>The modified lunge deeply stretches the back leg’s quads and hip
                flexors, especially the rectus femoris, by pulling the foot toward the glutes with the knee on the
                ground. It opens the front of the hips but doesn’t target the hamstrings like straight-leg stretches do.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="wolfe_stretch">
            <img src="img/Wolfe Stretch.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the wolfe stretch">
            <p><strong>Wolfe Stretch: </strong>The Wolfe stretch is an informal term for a deep lunge-based stretch
                targeting the hip flexors and quads, with the back foot pulled toward the glutes. It’s common in
                flexibility training for dance, gymnastics, and contortion.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="side_splits">
            <img src="img/Side Split.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the side splits">
            <p><strong>Side Splits: </strong>Side splits stretch the inner thighs (adductors), hamstrings, and hip
                flexors. This position
                increases hip and leg flexibility and is used in dance, martial arts, and gymnastics. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="middle_splits">
            <img src="img/Middle Splits.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the middle splits">
            <p> <strong>Middle Splits: </strong>Middle splits target the inner thighs (adductors), hips, and groin,
                promoting deep lateral flexibility. This stretch improves side-to-side hip opening, increases mobility
                in the pelvic region, and strengthens joint control. It requires consistent practice and gradual
                progression to safely achieve full range without strain.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="bridge">
            <img src="img/Bridge.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the bridge stretch">
            <p><strong>Bridge:</strong> The bridge stretch opens the chest, shoulders, hip flexors, and spine while
                strengthening the
                glutes and back. It also improves backbend flexibility and front-body extension. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="shoulder_stretch">
            <img src="img/Shoulder Stretch.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the shoulder stretch">
            <p><strong>Shoulders: </strong>Shoulder stretches (like arm crosses or wall stretches) improve mobility in
                the deltoids,
                rotator cuff, and upper back. These stretches help with posture and arm range of motion, especially
                useful for overhead activities. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="wrists">
            <img src="img/Wrist Stretch.jpg" alt="Woman demonstrating the wrist stretch">
            <p><strong>Wrists:</strong> Wrist stretches (like palm-up/down flexes or floor leans) target the forearm
                flexors and
                extensors. They're essential for relieving tension and building flexibility in the wrists and hands,
                especially after typing or weight-bearing activities like yoga. </p>
