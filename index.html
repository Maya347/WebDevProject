        <p>To practice on the wall:</p>
        <ul id="handstand">
            <li>Find an empty wall. It does not have to be flat. As long as you can kick up, you're good.</li>
            <li>Place your hands about 8 in away from the wall and kick up.</li>
            <li>Stay in this position for 3 to 5 seconds. Focus on squeezing your core muscles and using your fingers to
                distribute weight.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Practice consistantly</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
