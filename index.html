        <p>To practice on the wall:</p>
        <ol>Find an empty wall. It does not have to be flat. As long as you can kick up, you're good.</ol>
        <ol>Place your hands about 8 in away from the wall and kick up.</ol>
        <ol>Stay in this position for 3 to 5 seconds. Focus on squeezing your core muscles and using your fingers to
            distribute weight.</ol>
        <ol><strong><em>Practice consistantly</em></strong></ol>
