        <h3>Practice on the wall first</h3>

        <p>To practice on the wall:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find an empty wall. It does not have to be flat. As long as you can kick up, you're good.</li>
            <li>Place your hands about 8 in away from the wall and kick up.</li>
            <li>Stay in this position for 3 to 5 seconds. Focus on squeezing your core muscles and using your fingers to
                distribute weight.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Practice consistantly</em></strong></li>
        </ul>

            <li>Box handstand holds: hands on floor, feet on box; practice straight line</li>

            <li>Handstand holds with spotter: someone supports legs lightly</li>
            <li>Freestanding holds from wall: push gently away from wall, balance</li>

        </ul>
