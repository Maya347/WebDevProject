   # Double check the responsiveness for mobile devices. It may not scale optimally if flexible units aren't consistently used.
   # I fixed this by adding a 600px media query on the handstand page to keep the pictures in line, the 1130px media query on the stretches page and the 1120px media query to the main page.
  #  Perhaps a consistent footer with a link back to the top (which the handstand page has) or maybe a link to go home so you don't need to scroll back up to thew home button (a nav bar that scrolls with you once you pass it on the page could be an answer).
  # I fixed this by adding the back to top button on every page.
  #  On the handstand page, maybe put the first paragraph in a text-box (similar to the info on the other pages) so that it's easier to digest, especially on larger screens where it's just 1 or 2 very long sentences.
  # I fixed this by turning that text to a h2 tag.
